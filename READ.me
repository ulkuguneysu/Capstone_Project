    "Smart Thermostat is a company that guarantees 15% annual savings and tenant comfort with our unique boiler monitoring and management system from the ground up that controls and monitors boilers and heating systems end-to-end. We built the most advanced physical controls (heat computers and sensors) on the market, and paired them with machine learning software that communicates and automatically manages the controls. \n",
    "\n",
    "We designed our heat control and sensor network from the ground up to use apartment temperature and boiler performance data thousands of times a second to control the boiler more effectively. The result is lower fuel usage, better quality of heat for tenants, and lower boiler service costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning software that automatically calibrates the control, by learning from each building individually. We are the first heating management service to use machine learning to automatically calibrate and adjust the settings for each building, based on that building's past performance, and the upcoming weather forecast that day. The result is an additional 5% reduction in heating costs, and an improvement in tenant comfort."
